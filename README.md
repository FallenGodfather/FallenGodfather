## About Me

Cybersecurity Penetration Tester focused on ethical hacking, network exploitation, and vulnerability assessment.  
Studying Cybersecurity at BTU Cottbus (Germany), preparing for CPTS, and actively completing Hack The Box active machines.

## Quick highlights
- 🎓 Cybersecurity student at **BTU Cottbus (Germany)**
- 📚 Preparing for **CPTS (Certified Penetration Testing Specialist)**
- 🧠 Enrolled in **HTB Academy – Penetration Tester Job Path**
- 🚩 Active on **Hack The Box** (Active Machines) — **Pro Hacker rank** on HTB Labs
- 🛠️ Building pentesting tooling + documenting practical learning

## What I do
I enjoy hands-on offensive security work across web, network, and Linux/Windows environments. I like turning reconnaissance into clear attack paths, then translating findings into actionable remediation advice.

## Current focus
- Strengthening end-to-end pentest workflow: scoping → recon → exploitation → privesc → reporting
- Web app security testing (auth, access control, injection, SSRF, file handling, deserialization)
- AD fundamentals and Windows privilege escalation (lab-based)
- Writing clean, reusable automation in Python and Bash

## Skills & tooling
**Core areas**
- Network enumeration & exploitation
- Web application penetration testing
- Linux & Windows privilege escalation
- Scripting for automation and repeatable workflows

**Tools I use often**
- Nmap, Burp Suite, Gobuster/Feroxbuster, Wireshark
- Metasploit (when appropriate), SQLMap (with care)
- John the Ripper, Hashcat
- Git, Docker basics, Linux (Kali/Parrot/Ubuntu)

**Languages**
- Python, Bash (plus basic PowerShell when needed)

## Certifications
- CPTS (HTB) — In progress

## Hack The Box
- Rank: Pro Hacker (HTB Labs)
- Actively completing: Active Machines
- Learning track: HTB Academy Penetration Tester Job Path

## Projects
A few things you’ll find here (or that I’m actively building):
- Pentest helper scripts (enumeration, parsing, report notes automation)
- Small security tools in Python (HTTP testing, subdomain checks, wordlist helpers)
- Lab notes and learning resources (sanitized, no active-machine spoilers)

## Write-ups policy
I don’t publish solutions for HTB Active Machines. For retired content, I may share high-level learning notes or sanitized write-ups focused on techniques, not spoilers.

## Goals for 2026
- Earn CPTS
- Keep improving web + AD pentesting depth
- Ship more polished open-source tooling and documentation
- Build a strong portfolio with clear methodology and measurable progress
